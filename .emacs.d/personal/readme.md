Stuff in my custom.el

* To enable emacs source jumping for C for mplab project:
- Installed ecb for code browsing. Feels kinds of slow.
- Installed global on windows with the win32 port from here
  - http://adoxa.altervista.org/global/
  - Ran GTAGs on root folder of harmony
  - Installed helm-gtags in emacs, setting as in custom.el,
    - instruction fetched from http://tuhdo.github.io/c-ide.html
- Not yet done code completion.

* To be able to edit FPGA code:
- Added '~/.emacs.d/ucf-mode/ucf-mode.el' to load path.
  This provide ucf file syntax highlighting.
